        In this unit, you're going to put everything you've learned so far 
        together to create a fun predictive text search app for fruit. 
        To do this, you'll extensively use DOM Manipulation, 
        advanced array methods, and the features of the ES2015
         update you just learned about. This project has been 
         designed to incorporate all the skills you've been learning so far 
         in the course. It will be a great portfolio piece to 
         show off your new skills. 
        
        This will be the most challenging project you've worked on to date. 
        We know you can do it and are here with all the support 
        you need, from the resources in our course to your mentor 
        and our student success team. And all of the frustrations
        you may encounter working on this won't even be close to 
        the pleasure and joy you'll get when it's completed and 
        functional. Best of luck, this is an awesome opportunity 
        to make something that pushes you to grow as a developer! `

        Be sure to follow each step of the instructions carefully 
        and closely. This project will incorporate everything that
        you’ve been learning in this course, from DOM manipulation
        the features of ES2015, so refer back to those sections 
        if you ever get stuck. Don’t hesitate to reach out to 
        your TA or mentor for advice along the way. Best of luck!
        When you have finished the exercise, submit it, and 
        discuss your code with your mentor. After that, you’ll 
        have a live code review where you walk through your code
        with an industry expert. You’ll also be asked to share
        your code with your Slack community.`
